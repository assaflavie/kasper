I love Wikipedia, but too often the articles are just not that easy to read. It's not that my English isn't good enough. My English good. There is [Simple English](http://simple.wikipedia.org/) Wikipedia, but it doesn't cover as many topics and it's not as thorough.

No, what bothers me about reading Wikipedia isn't the language, it's the editorial tone. Wikipedia is [normalized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization).

Here's what Wikipedia feels like to me:
### Watt
> The watt is the rate a source of energy uses or produces one joule during one second, ...

Er... Okay... I think I remember what a joule is [click]:
### Joule

> A joule is equal to the energy expended (or work done) in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre.

[sigh] [click]

### Newton 
> ... the unit of force ... needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 metre per second squared.

Okay. That makes sense, I think. So a joule is how much energy it takes to apply a force to accelerate 1kg, wait... force isn't the same thing as energy? [click]

## Diagnosis
Basically, reading Wikipedia, especially when it comes to science, is a tree traversal experience. ![A Tree Data Structure](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gigantt_pub_imgs/2014/04/1397593316.png)
It often takes more than a few clicks to reach understanding. You dive down, deeper and deeper with each click, then navigate back up and continue reading. **It's very easy to get lost and to lose your context**. Don't get me wrong, I realize it's an encyclopedia and not a textbook, and every article can't possibly explain every sub-article it links to. Yet this level of normalization yields a terse, unfriendly tone, which can be frustrating if you're new to the subject and don't understand many of the terms used.

## The Alternative

What I want is a way to flatten articles to accomodate my own particular knowledge gaps. I want related terms to be explained to me *inline*, and just deep enough for me to grasp them and not get distracted from the main article.

*(The above image is supposed to be animated. Open this article in a browser if it isn't)*

Notice that:

1. When you click on a term, it expands inline to show you the most minimal explanation first.
2. You can click on the ellipsis (...) to see a bit more of the explanation, if that first sentence wasn't enough for you.
3. You can dive deeper into multiple levels, all without losing your context.

What I also like about this is that you can even end up with a customized article, flattened according to your needs. Maybe even print it or save it as a one-pager that covers all the related terms. Could be fantastic for students.

## Feedback

Would you enjoy reading Wikipedia this way? I'm curious to know what other people think.
